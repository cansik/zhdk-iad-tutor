# Programming Refresh Course ZHdK

## About
The course lasts six weeks with three hours per week. Normally a block is divided into three parts (not connected):

* 1 hour theory
* 1 hour of work on a specific task (with the help of the teacher)
* 0.5 hours of task discussion and discussion
* 0.5 hours open Q/A

Week 1 to 4 are for the basic knowledge of programming. 5 to 6 focus more on specific advanced topics (`OSC`, `Video`, `Syphon`, `Sound`).

## Tools
* [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) / Java 8
* Tutorials
	* [Interaction Design Wiki ･ Programming](http://wiki.iad.zhdk.ch/PB)
	* [Processing Examples](https://processing.org/examples/)
